# ⚠️ Forewarning ⚠️ 
You are responsible for what you do on your twitch account, use these overrides with caution. I am not responsible for any account terminations which may occur from this tool.

## Twitch Experiments
A tool which allows you to generate a cookie to override experiments on the twitch website.

This tool redownloads the settings file every day. Not all experiments do anything - it's probably for the best if you only enable the ones you would like to use. 

### How to Use
Just select the experiment buckets you want then copy the cookie to the appropriate location.

Twitch's experiment parser also uses window search parameters so that's also an alternative.

### How to build
Take a look at the CI, basically

1. Clone the project 
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start when ready.
